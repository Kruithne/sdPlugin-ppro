# StreamDeck + Adobe Premiere Pro

> Note: This project is in development and is not yet ready for use. Please check back soon!

This is a plugin for the [Elgato Stream Deck](https://www.elgato.com/en/gaming/stream-deck) that allows you to take full control of [Adobe Premiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html) using the Stream Deck.

Going beyond keyboard shortcuts, this plugin allows you to run JavaScript directly inside the context of Premiere Pro, giving you full control.

- [x] Node.js context, with access to the full [Node.js API](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/).
- [x] ExtendScript context, with access to the full [ExtendScript API](https://extendscript.docsforadobe.dev/introduction/extendscript-overview.html).

Forget manually assigning keyboard shortcuts and chaining them together in multiactions; with this plugin you can automate almost anything you can think of with a single button.
